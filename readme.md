# Icons Task from team leader

This is the task requested from me after interview

I tried to run it online on openshit but i have a problem on my account

#### The created or edited files :

db migrations folder (creating tables in database)

db seeding folder (intializing some simple required data and test data into database)

routes file (installing routes and authentication middle ware)

models folder (adding models and it's relations)

views folder (adding views for user using blade and laravel collective)

controllers folder (create controller responsible for logic)


## Notice

I have made some advanced code for future use like :

actions are dynamic

roles also are dynamic

I wanted to use resource routes and resource controller 
if some one wish to add more functionality to the system like editing and deleting
